// Udacity API will be used to authenticate users of the app and to retrieve basic user info before posting data to Parse.
// FOR ALL RESPONSES FROM THE UDACITY API, YOU WILL NEED TO SKIP THE FIRST 5 CHARACTERS OF THE RESPONSE. These characters are used for security purposes. In the upcoming examples, you will see that we subset the response data in order to skip over the first 5 characters.
